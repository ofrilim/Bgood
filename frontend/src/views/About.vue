      <span class="about-header">dressing well and being eco-friendly simultaneously – This is the essence of B-GOOD!</span><br><br>
      <span>1. You can afford more and better stuff</span>, using the same amount you planned to spend.<br><br>
      <span>2. You help prevent environmental devastation</span><br>
      Consider the amount of recourses needed for the production of a new piece of clothing.
      – If it’s made from natural fibers, such as cotton, the land, water.
      – If the item is made with artificial fibers are made with coal and petrol, which makes this clothing unsustainable. 
      – Textile dyeing causes air and water pollution, and it affects the problem of worldwide water shortage.<br><br>
      <span>3. You reduce the size of landfills</span><br>
      landfills around the world are flooded with barely worn clothing, which leads to environmental issues with the soil, wildlife, and the sheer landmass.<br><br>
      <span>4. You can add unique pieces to your fashion arsenal</span><br>
      You can find gorgeous pieces that fit into whatever is currently trendy, yet different enough to stand out from the crowd.<br><br>
      <span>5. You won’t fund slave or child labor</span><br>
      Fashion is frequently using unsafe and unfair labor.The less we buy - the less people and children will be hurt.<br><br>
      <span>6. You support local economy and creativity.</span><br><br>
      We invite you to join us and be a B-good member - <br>
      You can buy and sell, and on the way make some difference and make the world a better place.
